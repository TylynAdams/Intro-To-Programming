# Lesson Number 4.1 Functions

# Lesson Outline #

Python Programming an Introduction to Computer Science by John Zelle. Third Edition

Chapter 6.1-6.3

## Intro ##

Today we are covering functions. A function is a way to repeat code without writing it over and over again. Being able to utilize functions will aide you in being able to keep your programs easy to write and read.

## Learning Outcomes ##

- Be able to describe what a function is and write one
- Be able to think about a program as a whole and break into easy chunks

## Vocabulary ##

- Functions

Code along with the book, you will be asked to turn in the Happy Birthday functions and the functions for the graph.

There are a couple of reasons why functions are important we will go over them.

The first reason is reusability. Once a function is defined, it can be used over and over and over again. You can invoke the same function many times in your program, which saves you work. Imagine what programming would be like if you had to teach the computer about sines every time you needed to find the sine of an angle! You'd never get your program finished!

Another aspect of reusability is that a single function can be used in several different (and separate) programs. When you need to write a new program, you can go back to your old programs, find the functions you need, and reuse those functions in your new program. You can also reuse functions that somebody else has written for you, such as the sine and cosine functions.

The second reason is abstraction. In order to use a particular function you need to know the following things:

The name of the function;
What the function does;
What arguments you must give to the function; and
What kind of result the function returns.
But notice: If you just want to use the function in your program, you don't have to know how it works inside! You don't have to understand anything about what goes on inside the function.

It's sort of like driving a car or using a telephone. With an automobile, you don't need to understand every detail about the engine and drive train and wheels, if all you want to do is drive the car. Similarly, with a telephone, you don't have to understand everything about the phone system in order to make a call.

The only time you need to know how a function works inside is when you need to write the function, or change how it works. (It's like a car again; you need to know how a car works in order to build one or fix one.) But once a function is written and working, you never need to look at its insides again.

Together, these two reasons make functions extremely useful--practically essential!-for programmers who write large programs. The ability to divide a program into abstract, reusable pieces is what makes it possible to write large programs that actually work right.


# Assignment #

For this assignment please include the exercises that you did in the book for the pages in this lesson.

Also, think of one of your favorite songs. One that has a chorus. Write out print statements for each line in the song. Then look back and see how you can simplify it using functions. Turn in your song example with the exercises above.s
